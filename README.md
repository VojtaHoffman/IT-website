# PreDigit
PreDigit is a web application that allows users to draw a digit and have it recognized by an AI model. It uses TensorFlow.js to train and run the model, and Chart.js to display the prediction probabilities as a bar chart.

## Getting Started
To get started with PreDigit, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a web browser. The application should work on most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Prerequisites
PreDigit requires the following dependencies:
* jQuery (v3.3.1 or later)
* Chart.js (v2.9.4 or later)
* TensorFlow.js (v2.8.0 or later)
* Bootstrap (v4.3.1 or later)

*These dependencies are included in the index.html file via CDN links, so an internet connection is required to use PreDigit.*

## Installation
To install PreDigit, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/VojtaHoffman/PreDigit.git`

Then, open the index.html file in a web browser to use the application.

## Usage
To use PreDigit, simply draw a digit on the canvas area using your mouse or touchpad. To clear the canvas, click the "Clear" button. To predict the digit, click the "Predict" button. The predicted digit and the prediction probabilities will be displayed in the result area.

## Built With
PreDigit was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with several third-party libraries and frameworks. The following is a list of the main technologies used in the project:

* HTML: The markup language used to structure the web page.
